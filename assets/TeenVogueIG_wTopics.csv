In short? Chloe can shred. âWhen I was 8 years old I went to Switzerland and really got into snowboarding. I was competing and starting to learn a lot of new tricks,â explains the athlete, who trains with the U.S. team. âI could never have imagined that I would get this far; it has all been a crazy and exciting adventure.â Chloe was selected as Team USAâs flag bearer for the 2016 Youth Olympic Games, where she took home two gold medals and became the highest scoring snowboarder in the history of the games at the time.

Pulling her inspiration from a combination of Mexican ornaments, Japanese portraits of women from the 1930âs, and Persian miniature art, Bodil's creations are the perfect balance of handmade and digital designs.  Showcasing her avant-garde looks on Instagram has brought many wonderful opportunities to Bodil. Unicef recently asked her to make an illustration about air pollution and it's effects on children's health which inspired her to continue to use her social presence for a good cause. Despite her successes, Bodil admits that sometimes she has off-days and feels insecure about her work. âOne time a girl said, 'Oh! You have the perfect life! You've got everything!'

We love Jessicaâs work not only for its obvious ode to #girlsgirlsgirls, but for the personality she so clearly puts into it.

Now, at 21, Alexis has amassed nearly 50k followers and is running her own business as a freelance artist, snagging nearly all of her jobs right here on Instagram. âWhen I created this account, I wasnât setting out to attract anyone. [It] was just my public sketchbook,â she mused. âI think the key is staying true to what you love. If you keep creating things for yourself, not what you think other people will like, regardless of the amount of followers you have, I believe authenticity is all you need.â For Alexis, her passion lies in drawing and painting people, with a fervent focus on diversity and inclusivity. âI love people. They donât even have to fit into a certain criteria, really.

Now youâll find the brilliant beauty walking her walk at shows for Givenchy and Public School, not to mention covering mega mags like Vogue Arabia. When sheâs not working, though, you can find Pooja meditating, slathering herself in coconut oil (same), and like any of usââgramming her life away. Which by the way, if you havenât already, definitely go follow her @poojamor to get an inside look at her ever-rising journey. Itâs sure to be a bright one.",0.9671237236826833,,,,,0

When sheâs not taking pics of eggs and avocados, sheâs a proponent for womenâs health, exercising, and âa good belly laugh.â Through her Instagram and her IRL work, she wants to âinspire people to be the best possible version of themselves,â and to âtouch as many lives as possibleââwhich, with her 100K+ followers, seems like a pretty reasonable goal. ð¥ Tag the biggest foodie in your life!

Regardless of how old you are, where you came from, your shade, your creed, or your orientation, you can go see Hamilton and expect one thing and leave with something else entirely. The show turns historical figures into human beings with personalities and flaws. It challenges you to be more understanding and empathetic toward everybody. And thatâs my favorite thing about being part of it.â ð¸: @TimBarberPhoto

Nevertheless, she persisted.â But as the saying goes, well-behaved women seldom make history. Itâs those who challenge, refuse to be silent, and speak loudly to their beliefs that change the world.

Grab a friend (youâll see why soon), gather your tools, and prepare to transform into a glitter goddess!\n\n1. Apply a foundation with yellow undertones using a dampened sponge.\n2. Set the foundation by dipping a fluffy brush in translucent powder and tapping it all over. \n3. Glide a flat brush dipped in a darker foundation shade under your cheekbones to contour.\n4. Create depth by shading your lids with the same color.\n5. Use your fingers to blend any harsh lines. \n6. Press a loose gold highlighter onto your finger and pat it on the high planes of your cheekbones. \n7. Highlight with a gold shadow.\n8. Dust a burgundy eyeshadow on your lids and lash line to create dimension. \n9. Fill in your lids with a chunky eye pencil in bronze to create a smoky effect. \n10.

Grab a friend (youâll see why soon), gather your tools, and prepare to transform into a glitter goddess!

1. Apply a foundation with yellow undertones using a dampened sponge.
2. Set the foundation by dipping a fluffy brush in translucent powder and tapping it all over. 
3. Glide a flat brush dipped in a darker foundation shade under your cheekbones to contour.
4. Create depth by shading your lids with the same color.
5. Use your fingers to blend any harsh lines. 
6. Press a loose gold highlighter onto your finger and pat it on the high planes of your cheekbones. 
7. Highlight with a gold shadow.
8. Dust a burgundy eyeshadow on your lids and lash line to create dimension. 
9. Fill in your lids with a chunky eye pencil in bronze to create a smoky effect.

Women are beautiful, insightful, inspiring creatures that have been held back by the patriarchy for far too long and [itâs] exciting to feel and be a part of this change.â ð",0.9796756708815604,,,,,0

In their upcoming book Radical Beauty, healthy guru @deepakchopra and nutritionist @_kimberlysnyder write that sleep isn\'t just important for brain function, its key for beauty perks, too.

""My mother, Anne Geddes, is a photographer,"" she says. ""My sister and I grew up living above her studio. I would often come home from school and mum would be shooting, so the studio environment has always felt natural to me.""

To Magdalena, #GirlGaze is, simply, âHow I view the world.â She shares that view by making sure that her camera never leaves her side â and thatâs the wisdom she hopes to impart on young aspiring photographers. âAlways have a camera with you,â Magdalena says. âAnd if you think you should stop and take a picture, then STOP and take the picture.â - Words by @hannamariehoward

And her unconventional past plays into her advice for other aspiring photogs. âSo many people think you have to be a lawyer or a doctor to be successful,â Haley says. âIf you are passionate about photography, you will be successful AND happy.â Her other passions include rescuing dogs from shelters and creating social change â both of which youâll find evidence of in her Instagram feed.

Haley, who published her first photography book 'The Watchers' in 2015, uses her own body to create her art. âI use my body as a tool in all of my work,â she says. âIt becomes a universal stand-in for my story that translates to many people.â And through that, her personal definition of #GirlGaze shines through. The photographer, who describes herself and her work as âPerformance Activist Empowerment,â says the movement is all about âempowering girls to create and control the gaze of the viewer of a photograph.â - words by @hannamariehoward

The L.A.-based photog, who cites Cass Bird and Harley Weir among her favorite women behind the lens, also uses fashion as a means to express herself. âClothing and accessories can transport you or make you feel a certain way,â Daria says. ""Regardless if you dress up or dress down, it says something about who you are at that moment in time.â 

Her love of dressing up and the rise of social media both played a role in her love for her art form of choice. âI think I got into photography because of MySpace,â she says. âI distinctly remember dressing up and going around town with my girlfriends taking photos of each other for our profile pictures.â For her, #GirlGaze is partially about being unapologetically a girl. âOur work cannot be separated from who we are and a huge part of that is our gender,â Daria says. âI am a relatively shy, petite, 24-year-old girl and my work is connected with my ability to connect with the subject and capture raw and vulnerable moments.â - Words by @hannamariehoward.

The self-professed Belieber â no, seriously, she loves the Biebs â most often uses her art to spotlight the female form. âThere are endless ways to photograph women,â she says. âYou can never get bored of it.â The 28-year-old, who cites Sandy Kim and Lina Scheynius among her favorite female photogs, came to photography in a way familiar to many of us â she started taking pictures on her phone. âI started developing an interest in photography when the first phones with a built-in camera came outâ¦ I was finally able to take photos without having to own a camera,â she says. âI wish I could find the thousands of photos I took with my phones.
