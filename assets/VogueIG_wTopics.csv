In my second year of shearing I would average 24 more a day than him. Now weâre friends."" Tap the link in our bio to read more stories from Katherine and other women shearers like her.

When her child began identifying strongly as male, she was initially happy. As a feminist, MontaÃ±a was turned off by Barbies, princesses, and any preoccupation with appearance. And when it became clear during second grade that it was more than a passing phase, she gladly helped her child socially transition to male and his chosen name, Q (pictured above). Now eleven, Q is beginning puberty, but MontaÃ±a is struggling with the concept of hormone-blocking drugs. âItâs a huge decision, and I need to weigh all the risks.

Pat McGrath (@patmcgrathreal) and Julien D\'Ys (@juliendys), the ultimate model transformers, are working their magic. Pepe Munoz is also hard at work, illustrating every look, every move. In the words of Queen Pat, ""It is MAJOR darling, MAJOR."" (And it is quite possibly the first time the haute couture has been shot exclusively for digital, so that\'s also MAJOR!) Soon Celine and the Vogue.com team will be back at the Ritz to finish the shoot. If you happen to pass the Place VendÃ´me, do as Katy Perry did and say hello.

Nine years ago Cass gave birth to their first child, Leo, and 20 months later Ali begat Mae. The Birds share photographs and videos weekly with more than 134,000 followers on Cassâs Instagram. The line between privacy and honesty is something that the couple negotiates together. âWe fight about it, and I fight about it internally,â Cass says. âWhat is promoting beauty and freedom and what is potentially harmful? I know that bodies are easily sexualized; I am not naive. I think they are beautiful, strong creatures. My goal is that no one would ever sexualize their image.â Says Ali, âCass is really aware of being a public figure who is gay and has the potential to affect other people who may feel they canât have a child or a family.â Cass adds, laughing, âCanât just everyone be naked?â In celebration of Vogue's 125th birthday we photographed American women, coast to coast.

She is listening to music, because music is her thing: Her BF is a songwriter (âHe writes parables!â), and her own tastes are a mix of major divas (RiRi, BeyoncÃ©, âof courseâ), rap (Jay Z), and R&B (Drake). She craves some semblance of musicianship in contemporary tunes. Of the Bieber/Skrillex/Diplo collaboration, she scoffs, âWhat instruments are those? Not even real.â Hill says, âWhen David Bowie died, I thought, Why donât people make music like this anymore? Music with instruments!â You can tune in next Friday, March 18, to Vogue.com to see the real Taylor Hill really model some of the most on-key clothes from this week in Paris.
